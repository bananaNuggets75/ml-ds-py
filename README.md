# Machine Learning/Data Science Repository

This repository is intended for side projects, experiments, and learning resources related to machine learning and data science. There is nothing special here for the time being, simply because I am still in the learning phase

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Provide a space for exploring various machine learning algorithms and techniques.
- Share resources, tutorials, and code snippets related to data science.
- Collaborate on potential projects in the future.

## Current Status

This repository is in its initial stages and does not have specific projects yet. It serves as a placeholder for future developments and contributions.
